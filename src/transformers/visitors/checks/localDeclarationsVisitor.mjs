 * @desc:
 * Visitor throws a warning if the user is trying to compile Solidity which
 * declares a local variable within a function.
 * Local variables are tricky to deal with (and are a future enhancement),
 * because they might interact with public and/or private states. Deciding
 * which logic should remain in the shield contract, and which should be moved
 * into the circuit is tricky (as is making sure the parameters to the circuit
 * align with those decisions).
